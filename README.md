# Project Title

Test case for one of my user stories.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To Run these test cases you need to have the following:

* python version 2 or 3 installed on your machine.
* unittest module (installed by default)

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

No additional dependencies are required to run these unittest test cases. This python program is self contained and only uses libraries provided by python's pre-installed packages.


## Running the tests

To run the test, first make sure that you are inside the testing directory. To run a specific test, run the following command
```
python -m unittest test.test_to_run
```
For Example:
```
python -m unittest test.test_create_project_directory
```
You should see the following message appear:
'''
...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 0.001s

OK
'''
